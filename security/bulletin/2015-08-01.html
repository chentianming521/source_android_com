<p><em>Published August 13, 2015</em></p>

<p>We have released a security update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air
(OTA) update as part of our Android Security Bulletin Monthly Release process.
The Nexus firmware images have also been released to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">Google Developer site</a>. Builds LMY48I or later address these issues. Partners were notified about these
issues on June 25, 2015 or earlier.</p>

<p>The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files.</p>

<h2 id=security_vulnerability_summary>Security Vulnerability Summary</h2>

<p>The table below contains a list of security vulnerabilities, the Common
Vulnerability and Exposures ID (CVE), and their assessed severity. The <a href="../overview/updates-resources.html#severity">severity assessment</a> is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on an
affected device, assuming the platform and service mitigations are disabled for
development purposes or if successfully bypassed. </p>

<h2 id=mitigations>Mitigations</h2>


<p>This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the <a href="../enhancements/index.html">Android security platform</a> and service protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities can be successfully exploited on
Android.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
the latest version of Android where possible.
  <li> The Android Security team is actively monitoring for abuse with Verify Apps and
SafetyNet which will warn about potentially harmful applications about to be
installed. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play. To protect
users who install applications from outside of Google Play, Verify Apps is
enabled by default and will warn users about known rooting applications. Verify
Apps attempts to identify and block installation of known malicious
applications that exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an
application has already been installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and
attempt to remove any such applications.
  <li> As appropriate, Google has updated the Hangouts and Messenger applications so
that media is not automatically passed to vulnerable processes (such as
mediaserver.)
</ul>

<h3 id=integer_overflows_during_mp4_atom_processing>Integer overflows during MP4 atom processing</h3>


<p>There are several potential integer overflows in libstagefright that could
occur during MP4 atom processing, leading to memory corruption and potentially
remote code execution as the mediaserver process.</p>

<p>The affected functionality is provided as an application API and there are
multiple applications that allow it to be reached with remote content, most
notably MMS and browser playback of media.</p>

<p>This issue is rated as a Critical severity due to the possibility of remote
code execution as the privileged mediaserver service. While mediaserver is
guarded with SELinux, it does have access to audio and video streams as well as
access to privileged kernel driver device nodes on many devices that 3rd party
apps cannot normally access. Note that under our previous severity rating
guidelines, this was rated as a High severity vulnerability and was reported to
partners as such. Under our new guidelines, published in June 2015, it is a
Critical severity issue.</p>

<h3 id=an_integer_underflow_in_esds_processing>An integer underflow in ESDS processing</h3>


<p>There is a potential integer underflow in libstagefright that could occur
during ESDS atom processing, leading to memory corruption and potentially
remote code execution as the mediaserver process.</p>

<p>The affected functionality is provided as an application API and there are
multiple applications that allow it to be reached with remote content, most
notably MMS and browser playback of media.</p>

<p>This issue is rated as a Critical severity due to the possibility of remote
code execution as the privileged mediaserver service. While mediaserver is
guarded with SELinux, it does have access to audio and video streams as well as
access to privileged kernel driver device nodes on many devices that 3rd party
apps cannot normally access. Note that under our previous severity rating
guidelines, this was rated as a High severity vulnerability and was reported to
partners as such. Under our new guidelines, published in June 2015, it is a
Critical severity issue.</p>

<h3 id=remotely_exploitable_memcpy_overflow_in_p2p_add_device_in_wpa_supplicant>Remotely exploitable memcpy() overflow in p2p_add_device() in wpa_supplicant</h3>


<p>When wpa_supplicant is operating in WLAN Direct mode, it's vulnerable to
potential remote code execution due to an overflow in the p2p_add_device()
method. Successful exploitation could result in code execution as the 'wifi'
user in Android.</p>

<p>There are several mitigations that can effect successful exploitation of this
issue:</p>

<p>- WLAN Direct is not enabled by default on most Android devices</p>

<p>- Exploitation requires an attacker to be locally proximate (within WiFi range)</p>

<p>- The wpa_supplicant process runs as the 'wifi' user which has limited access
to the system</p>

<p>- Remote exploitation is mitigated by ASLR on Android 4.1 and later devices.</p>

<p>- The wpa_supplicant process is tightly constrained by SELinux policy on
Android 5.0 and greater</p>

<p>This issue is rated as High severity due to the possibility of remote code
execution. While the 'wifi' service does have capabilities that are not
normally accessible to 3rd party apps which could rate this as Critical, we
believe the limited capabilities and level of mitigation warrant decreasing the
severity to High.</p>

While this type of vulnerability would normally be rated as High severity, the
severity has been reduced because the data that is leaked in a successful

<p>ActivityManager's getProcessRecordLocked() method doesn't properly verify that
an application's process name matches the corresponding package name. In some
cases, this can allow ActivityManager to load the wrong process for certain

<p>The implications are that an app can prevent Settings from being loaded or
inject parameters for Settings fragments. We don't believe that this
vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary code as the "system" user.</p>

<p>While the ability to access capabilities normally only accessible to "system"
would be rated as a High severity, we rated this one as a Moderate due to the
limited level of access granted by the vulnerability.</p>

<h3 id=unbounded_buffer_read_in_libstagefright_while_parsing_3gpp_metadata>Unbounded buffer read in libstagefright while parsing 3GPP metadata</h3>


<p>An integer underflow during parsing of 3GPP data can result in a read operation
overrunning a buffer, causing mediaserver to crash.</p>

<p>This issue was originally rated as a High severity and was reported to partners
as such, but after further investigation it has been downgraded to Low severity
as the impact is limited to crashing mediaserver.</p>
